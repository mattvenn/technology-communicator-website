In 2017 I joined [Dygma](https://www.dygma.com) as CTO. Together with Manel and Luis we prototyped and developed a split, ergonomic keyboard that was crowdfunded in early 2018.

While I had done plenty of PCB design and prototyping before, there is a big difference between building a few prototypes and building something to sell in quantity. 

The prototype we built to use in the kickstarter promo was fairly easy to make, but getting ready to build 5000 units was a totally different story.

Some of the differences include:

* design for manufacture
* design for test
* design for a cost
* certifications required to sell in different countries
* writing documentation for other people

While all of these had their specific challeges I want to focus on the long journey involved in passing all the EMC certifications.

This is a puzzle box. To open it you need to perform a certain gesture and press a button. The gesture is defined by the shape of an internal ball bearing maze. 

I created a website with graphic designer [Gavin Wilshen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavinwilshen/?originalSubdomain=uk) that alowed you to easily create a custom maze and then generate DXF downloads for a laser cutter.

I learnt a lot about interactivity on websites, laser cutting, parametric design and running a small business.

I made a few hundred boxes for people over a couple of years, but it was one of those labour of love projects that I eventually archived.

I still remember the gesture needed to open my first box - amazing how long muscle memory lasts!
